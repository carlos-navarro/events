    abstract: "Recently, there are significant number of \"fake quotations\" on our website in ADJ.\nThose fake quotes may be done by competitors to investigate our price and lead to disturb our statistics (number of quotations, conversion rate) used to monitor our business and define our strategy.\nSo, it is an important issue for us to detect this kind of quotation.\nIn this session, we will show the way to detect \"fake quotes\" using an anomaly detection method. And what business decisions have been made to solve this issue.\n\n// Key Learnings:\nFeatures of fake quotes in Japan / Method of identifying fake quotes in an unsupervised framework / Business discussions arising around this issue: Alignment on the definition of adjusted KPI, Actions to take (identify those fake quotes only? blocking them: how?)",
